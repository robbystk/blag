Developed based on "Polenta with Mushroom Sauce" and "Shrimp and Grits"
by Janet A. Zimmerman in _The Ultimate Instant Pot Cookbook for Two_.

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 c. water
- 1/2 c. polenta
- 1 c. milk
- 1 c. chicken stock
- 1/4 tsp. salt
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese (optional)

## Steps
1. Place a shallow trivet in the instant pot and add water.
2. In one-quart heat-proof bowl, combine polenta, milk, chicken stock, and salt.
   Mix well.
3. Place the bowl on the trivet in the instant pot
4. Pressure cook on high pressure for 15 minutes.
   Let stand at pressure for 10 minutes, then release the pressure.
5. Carefully remove the bowl from the instant pot.
6. Stir the polenta until smooth.
7. Stir in butter and cheese until melted
8. Taste and adjust seasoning

I think this is a really great way to cook polenta.
It requires no stirring and is easy to clean up.

We made it to go with some salmon and saut√©ed green beans, and it was delicious.
