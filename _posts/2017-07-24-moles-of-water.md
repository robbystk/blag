According to [USGS](https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthhowmuch.html),
there is 332,500,000 cubic miles of water on, in and above the earth.
This is equivalent to \\(1.386\times10^{24} \,\mathrm{g}\\).
Dividing by the atomic mass of water (\\(18.015 \,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{mol}\\))
gives \\(7.693\times 10^{22} \,\mathrm{mol}\\).
This is suspiciously close to avogadros number,
\\(6.022141\times 10^{23} \,/\mathrm{mol}\\).
In fact, dividing by it results in \\(0.127 \,\mathrm{mol}\\) of mols.
That's about an eighth of a mol . . . of mols.
There is almost a mol squared of water on the earth.
