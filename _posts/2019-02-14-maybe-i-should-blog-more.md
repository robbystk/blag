I thought it might be nice to blog more for some accountability.
If I know someone might see what I do in a given day,
I might make better choices.

Today I got up slowly and went to the gym.
Then I ran various errands after lunch.
In the afternoon I watched far to many videos
until about 8 PM when I got hungry and ate incredibly unhealthy fast food
in a moment of weakness.
I am now preparing to shave and then continue where I left off
with a test-driven development tutorial.
