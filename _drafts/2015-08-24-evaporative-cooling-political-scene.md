[Evaporative Cooling](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/) 
is a phenomenon in which the beliefs of a group become more extreme over 
time.  One member professes an slightly more-extreme view or idea, and a few
of the more-skeptical, less-extreme members are driven away.  Without their
opposing ideas, the group's average beliefs become slightly more-extreme.
