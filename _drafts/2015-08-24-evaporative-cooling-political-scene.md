[Evaporative Cooling](http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/) 
is a phenomenon in which the beliefs of a group become more extreme over 
time.  One member professes an slightly more-extreme view or idea, and a few
of the more-skeptical, less-extreme members are driven away.  Without their
opposing ideas, the group's average beliefs become slightly more-extreme.  

I argue a similar thing is happening with the political scene, not with
the different sides of the conflict, but with both sides together and the 
way political discourse is carried out.  

Most everyone would like to discuss politics in a reasonable, civilized 
manner, where ideas are analyzed and evaluated without regard to who voiced 
them.  Inevitably though, one encounters people who use personal attacks, 
silencing, censorship, and shaming to counter ideas they disagree with.  
Such tactics have become especially prevalent in the age of social media 
where ideas can be immediately shared among people with similar views.
