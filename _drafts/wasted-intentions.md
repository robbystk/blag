# Wasted Intentions

Last Edited: May 02, 2019 4:52 PM

Last night, my partner and I both went to Facebook to look up the location of an event happening later that evening.  Within seconds of opening the site, both of us were completely derailed from our intended task.  I was scrolling my timeline and she was looking at friend requests.  

I was struck by how effective the distracting power of facebook must be for it to catch us both so quickly.  This power is not unique to facebook of course, I'm sure similar effects could be observed on other social media sites.

The fact that we both had a set task in mind when we initially visited but were both instantly knocked off-course is a testament to the power of the psychological tricks and traps the site employs.  It gives me new respect—and fear—for the effect of social media and the future of humanity.  

The other scary thing is how easy it is to be completely unaware of all of this.  I only noticed because both of us were trying to do the same thing.  If I'd been by myself, I'd have chalked up getting distracted to my own lack of focus—if I even noticed.  

Another thing is that I know on some level how the psychological tricks work and how they might be executed, but I have no way to dig deeper?  Are these techniques that humans have invented and published?  Do they have names?  Or are they the product of some faceless optimization process following hints from a billion users down to a local minimum?

There is clearly a conflict between how I'd like to apply my brainpower and attention and how apps and other companies would like it to be applied.  Resolving that conflict may well be the most-important problem of the 21st century.
