title:  Inadvertently Optimizing Your Brain for Instant Gratification

The internet is a wonderful invention
which is able to connect people around the world
and foster collaboration and sharing of knowledge like nothing else can.
It is also a terrible, _horrible_ waste of time.
The number of distracting articles, blog posts, videos, and silly flash games
available at a moments notice is astronomical
and allows one to indulge in any urge that happens to strike almost immediately.
Perhaps it's because I took a machine-learning class
and am thinking of everything in those terms,
but I can't help but wonder what effect this has on the brain.

The brain is remarkably plastic and can re-wire itself
in response to whatever stimulus it encounters.
This is how practicing something by repeating it over and over
leads to eventual expertise---the brain responds to the repeated stimulus
by optimizing (but not fully) for performing the practiced task.
Pathways are reinforced, concepts linked, and synapses formed.

What then, will be the effect of repeatedly (even if rarely)
indulging in the urge to consume the provoking article,
the enlightening blog post, the amusing video?
A sobering thought.
