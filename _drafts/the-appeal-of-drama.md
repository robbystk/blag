In a sci-fi story when all the shit hits the fan at once and so many disasters
strike that it almost breaks your immersion, the chaos itself is not the main
appeal.  Instead, the chaos provides a backdrop to allow the characters to flex
their problem-solving prowess.  For me, that is the main appeal.  I suspect
there is a similar phenomenon with drama: In romances, soap operas, and other
stereotypically dramatic genres, the appeal is not the drama itself but how the
characters react and adapt to it.
