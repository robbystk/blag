- solution to disparate problems is topologically similar
- PCA or autoencoder
    - problem: many dimensions; noise
    - solution: project into low-D, capturing variance
    - benefits: reduce dimension and noise while maintaining accuracy
- spatial filter in optics
    - problem: bumps in spatial mode (which then diffract)
    - solution: focus light onto pinhole
    - benefits: removes all except clean gaussian mode
- writing
    - problem: jaggedness from repeated revision
    - solution: compress into brief outline and rewrite completely
    - benefits:
        - smoothness and continuity
        - facilitates reorganization for even better flow
        - fast because you've already figured it all out
- Three different problems, one solution.
