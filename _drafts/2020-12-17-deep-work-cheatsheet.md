This is a summary outline of all chapter and section headings
in [Deep Work by Cal Newport][deep work].
This is just a navigational reference for me,
because the book's table of contents only goes one level deep.

## Part 1: The Idea
- Chapter 1: Deep Work is Valuable
    - 
- Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare
    - 
- Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful
    - 

## Part 2: The Rules
- Rule #1: Work Deeply
- Rule #2: Embrace Boredom
- Rule #3: Quit Social Media
- Rule #4: Drain the Shallows
