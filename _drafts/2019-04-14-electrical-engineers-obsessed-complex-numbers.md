title:  "Why Electrical Engineers Are Obsessed With Complex Numbers

If you've ever taken a college-level electrical engineering course, or talked to an electrical engineer at length, you may know that they seem to have a strange affitnity for complex numbers.  Why is that?  What kind of brainwashing could make someone thingk that *complex* numbers are simpler?

The simple reason is that complex numbers make analyzing oscillating things easier.  These types of oscillating phenomena are frequently encountered in electrical power distribution ("the grid"), audio signals, signals from any kind of sensors, and electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, microwaves, and visible light.

But how do complex numbers help when dealing with waves?  The goal of this post is explain that intuitively.

Look at the picture of the sine wave above.  This is the type of signal that we're talking about.  

- two different phases can have the same value, phasors distinguish them
- Interference is an important phenomenon when dealing with waves
- phasors capture this
- solve the same problem without phasors and then with
- Also behavior of an inductor or capacitor when stimulated with an oscillating signal.
- This might need to be split into two posts
