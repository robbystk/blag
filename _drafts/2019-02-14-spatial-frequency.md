In signal processing, it is common to consider _temporal_ frequencies
which describe oscillations with respect to time.
It is common to analyze how a system will affect a signal
in terms of how it will affect any frequency that may be present in the signal.
Thus, systems are often characterized by their _frequency response_
which is also called the _transfer function_.

Optics also involves signals passing through systems,
but instead of electronic signals passing through circuits,
two-dimensional light patterns pass through lenses and other optical elements.
The same mathematics applies,
but the signals are now functions of _two spatial variables_
rather than one temporal variable.

Whereas signals that change as a function of _time_
can be analyzed in terms of _temporal_ frequencies,
signals that change as a function of position or _space_
can be analyzed in terms of _spatial_ frequencies.

- example of temporal frequency
- example of spatial frequency
- image instead of graph
- tilted s.p.
- break down by cross-sections in x and y
- equation looks more-complicated,
- but if we change coordinates, we can remove that complexity
- Can interpret spatial frequency as a vector that gets dotted with spatial position
- points in the direction of propagation

- part 2 on spatial frequency picture of diffraction.
