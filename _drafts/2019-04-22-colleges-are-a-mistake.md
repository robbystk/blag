Professors are between admin and the students.  They have to bend over backwards
to get funding for the research they want to do and have to teach which they
aren't necessarily good at.  Even the admin may often be risen professors who
aren't adept at leadership or management.  Students are at the mercy of the
professors teaching style or lack thereof.  And it's all wrapped in junk food,
sex and drugs.
